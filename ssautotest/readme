Super Simple Autotest
Execute test anywhere


This project is abolished for reasons:

1. Cannot deal with test hosts well. Only can be specified in cases, but should be aparted from case codes.
2. Bugs in results handling, when test iterations > 1 and in different hosts, new results may cover the old.
